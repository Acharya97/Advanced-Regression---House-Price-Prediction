# Advanced Regression - Housing Price Prediction 
## Problem Statement. 
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.<br><br> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.


## The company wants to know:
* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
* How well those variables describe the price of a house.
* Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
- The traditional linear regression model was over fitting and did not give the accurate results. Therefore, tried Lasso and Ridge regression to tune the model and get better results.
- As mentioned, Lasso is a better option because it eliminates the insignificant variables. Thus we have identified few of the variables which can help predicting the housing price
